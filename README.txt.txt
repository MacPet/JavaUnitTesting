Project written using:
Java 17,
Maven,
Junit 5,
Spring boot,
Mockito 5,
Gherkin,
PostgreSQL

Used this project to learn the basics of unit testing, behaviour-driven development and test-driven development.
Also used it as an opportunity to learn more about the Java ecosystem.

Parts of the project may currently be untranslated from Polish.

Project may require a local installation of maven or an IDE equipped with maven to be build.
I personally used Intellij.

For some functionalities, eq. the blacklist, you need to run an instance of PostgreSQL.
